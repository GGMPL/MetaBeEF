# MetaBeEF
MetaBeEF is a bash script that initializes Browser Exploitation Framework with Metasploit for Linux [for now ;)]

### Installation
You have to give permissions to that file. That's all. To do this type:
```sh
$ chmod +x metabeef.sh
```


### Launching
To run this script type:
```sh
$ ./metabeef.sh
```
**Warning!** This script doesn't make any changes to your config files. You have to do it by yourself!
